# Accessibility Report

## Principles of Universal Design
- **Principle 1: Equitable Use**
  - Our program is designed to ensure that all users, regarless of ability, have equal access to functionality. For example visible labels in the UI promote usablity 
for a wide range of users.
  - Future improvements such as alternate text for book covers and screen reader support would enhance accessbility for visually impaired users.

- **Flexibility in Use**
  - The Search functionality allows users to query books using partial or complete titles, catering to users with varying levels of familiarity with the material
  - In the long run, enhancements such as voice input and keyboard shortcuts would provide additional flexibility for users who have mobility impairments.

- **Simple Use**
  - The interface follows common UI conventions, such as labeled buttons ("Search", "Join a club") and logical grouping of elements. This simplifies use for first-time users.
  - Tooltips or a brief tutorial on first launch could make the program even more user-friendly.

- **Perceptible Information**
- Information is conveyed effectively through multiple modes.
- The program uses clear, contrasting colors and distinct font sizes to ensure visibility and readability of text elements.
- High-contrast mode and audio cues for critical actions (e.g., search failure) could improve accessibility for users with vision impairments.

- **Tolerance for Errors**
 - The program provides error messages for invalid or blank search queries, helping users understand what went wrong and how to fix it.
 - Adding "Undo" options for actions or suggestions for misspelled search queries could further reduce user frustration.

- **Low Physical Effort**
  - The program minimizes required interactions by providing a straightforward search process and a single-click "Back to Search" button.
  - Keyboard navigation support or customizable shortcut keys would make it more accessible for users with limited dexterity.

- **Size and Space for Approach and Use**
  - The UI components, such as buttons and input fields, are adequately spaced for easy use.
  - Adapting the layout for different screen sizes and resolutions (e.g., mobile devices) could ensure accessibility across platforms.

## Potential Demographic Limitations

While the program is designed to be inclusive, there may be challenges for certain demographics:
- **Users with Limited Internet Access**: As the program relies on online features, individuals with poor connectivity might face difficulties.
- **Elderly Users**: Without targeted training, older users unfamiliar with technology may find the program less intuitive.
- **Non-English Speakers**: Currently, the program does not support localization, which limits its accessibility to non-English-speaking users.

**Future Considerations**:
- Implement offline support to mitigate issues related to poor connectivity.
- Provide multilingual support and tutorials to reach a broader audience.
