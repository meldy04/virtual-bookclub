## Page Turners: A General Introduction:
Page Turners is a virtual book-club that lets you join book-clubs that you are interested in or create book-clubs if you 
don't find something suitable to your liking. Additionally, you can maintain personal notes about the current books that
you are reading and access the list of books in a book-club. The search function lets you search for your next big read.
Our project has the primary goal of enhancing a book lover's dream.
